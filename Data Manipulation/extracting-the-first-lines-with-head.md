# Intro to Commands 

**Problem** : The problem is to find flag by piping the first 7 lines of a prohram to /challenge/college
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{gA8gVjkYiiFlSoxiLSbHW22SiUP.0lNxEzNxwSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag.


Inputed the command
bash
```bash

 /challenge/pwn | head -n 7 | /challenge/college

```


## What I learned
> * *head* we can print the first 10 lines of file
> * the number of lines or size of file can be controlled by *-n* and *-c* respectively
