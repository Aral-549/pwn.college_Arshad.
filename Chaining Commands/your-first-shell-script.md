**Problem** : The problem is to run /challenge/pwn /challenge/college in bash file
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{gH5CG0EKmKL0lEmjbPZ3NMK5m23.01M0MDOxwSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** : added the commands  /challenge/pwn /challenge/college order wise by editiong using the *vim* command and ran the file *x.sh* using bash
  
```bash  
 vim x.sh 

 bash x.sh
```


## What I learned
> * in order to avoid writing same codes multiple times we can use bash to ru the *.sh* files repeatedly
