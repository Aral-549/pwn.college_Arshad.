**Problem** : The problem is to run /challenge/run in background using bg command and again running another  /challenge/run in foreground

## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{MJGVZtIR2FnTc9Xm8MMhxDP5ZKN.QX3QDO0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag.

Inputed the command
bash
```bash
/challenge/run #ctrl + z

bg

/challenge/run


```
