**Problem** : The problem is to assaign the variable *PWN* a value *COLLEGE*

## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{khPkw8wRTYynaoP3NN94nkkFSfp.QX5UTN0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag.

Inputed the command
bash
```bash
PWN=COLLEGE

```


## What I learned
> * variable is like a jar we can assaign a value to it no need to declare
> * it can hold a string a character or a number
> * can print them using *$name*
> * assaigning variables format : **variable=value** (*no spaces*)
