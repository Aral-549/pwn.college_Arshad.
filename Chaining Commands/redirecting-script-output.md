**Problem** : The problem is to run /challenge/pwn followed by /challenge/college in a sheel and pipe it into /challenge/solve 
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{0UR0-sN1sx7vS2vJgi74rprVs6H.QX4ETO0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :  used the created *x.sh* file and piped its output into */challenge/solve*
  
```bash  
 bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
```
