**Problem** : The problem is to join the program  /challenge/pwn /challenge/college
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Al5OCaxlt7OOSpcmw3wMAOg8grB.QX1UDO0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :  Sucessfully connected the programs with semicolon

    
```bash  
/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college

```

## What I learned
