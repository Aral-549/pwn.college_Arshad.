# Intro to Commands 

**Problem** : The problem is to invoke  "/challenge/run"
the absolute path 
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{QdCfcTDWezQXvw-SyJBoKDvFDwd.QX1QTN0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions to get the flag.

Inputed the command
```bash
  /challenge/run

```
Noted that inputting pwn does not work as its not  an absolute path

## What I learned
> learned  how files are stored in linux
>
> 
> learned to navigate more complicated absolute path
