**Problem** : The problem is to invoke   "/challenge/run"
 absolute path in '/' Directory. 
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{o5RpVQpb-h9be93jDsL0-lcZX2f.QX2QTN0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions to get the flag.

Inputed the command
bash 
```bash
cd /

/challenge/run

```
Noted that inputting pwn does not work as its not  an absolute path
