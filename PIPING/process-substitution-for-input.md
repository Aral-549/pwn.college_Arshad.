**Problem** : The problem is to use *diff* to compare output of two commands

## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{ot80yupTYhlTkJmME3l3hYe1nhZ.0lNwMDOxwSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag.

Inputed the command

bash
```bash
 diff <( /challenge/print_decoys) <(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)

```
