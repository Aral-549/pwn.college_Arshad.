**Problem** : The problem is to assaign variables to certain values and export only certain variables
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q31nQ63xOEDPXdgDnHz8-coihKm.QXyYTN0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag.

Inputed the command

bash
```bash
PWN=COLLEGE

COLLEGE=PWN

/challenge/run
```


## What I learned
> * variable can be exported by : *export var*

> * exporting variable means these variables can be used in the baby shells
