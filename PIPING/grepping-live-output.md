**Problem** : The problem is to find flag with help of *grep* and pipe operator(*|*)
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cnJIgViarTv9vAacne7rSLNwwg6.QX5EDO0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag.


the output of the /challenge/run command is directly sent to grep therby creating no temp files


Inputed the command
bash
```bash
 /challenge/run | grep pwn.college

```


## What I learned
> * with the help of *|* operator we can stack and use multiple commands
