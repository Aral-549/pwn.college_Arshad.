# Intro to Commands 

**Problem** : The problem is to invoke  command  the absolute path "/challenge/challenge" with a specific argument

## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cUHrBIgwEo20YC65VTHbC1f9fZU.QX2EDO0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag
first used man man to understand how to search the entire man database
first , used the man -K command to find the instructions needed to invoke the flag

Inputed the command
bash
```bash
man man


man -K /challenge/challenge


/challenge/challenge --crgwob 206

```

## What I learned
>* learn how to search manuals in linux
>
>
>* Difference b/w *man -k* and *man -K*.
>  
>
>* *man -k* searches names and discription but *man -K* searches entire Text
