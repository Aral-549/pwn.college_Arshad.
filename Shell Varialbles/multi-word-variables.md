**Problem** : The problem is to assaign a variable containing value with spaces
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{AwSkQ3Rp18aDXxDtr5HHig5PTVb.QXwYTN0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag.

Inputed the command
bash
```bash
 PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"

```


## What I learned
> * variable is like a jar we can assaign a value to it no need to declare
> * it can hold a string a character or a number
> * can print them using *$name*
> *  Assaigning value : **variable="Value1 Value2"**(*In case there are spaces*)
