# Intro to Commands 

**Problem** : The problem is to invoke pwn command in the absolute path 
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{A7NgwFBxUm-TMSaD9EB6FZ9BaiI.QX4cTO0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions to get the flag.

Inputed the command
```bash
/pwn
```
Noted that inputting pwn does not work as its not  an absolute path
