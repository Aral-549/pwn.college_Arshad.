**Problem** : The problem is to run /challenge/solve w/o using bash and by making it executable
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{06I84iBAVwAqjt_qcrMIb0co607.QX0cjM1wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** : made a file named *script.sh* and made it executable using *chmod* and ran it to obtain the flag

  
```bash  
vim script.sh #/challenge/solve 

chmod u+x script.sh

./script.sh
```
