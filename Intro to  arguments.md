# Intro to Commands 

**Problem** : it asks to type hello as a  command and hackers as an argument
compared to writing echo(command)+ (argument) to find the flag
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{QU-fM1TXuSJAk-U6lphleIGvh64.QX4YjM1wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :  just  followed the instructions to get the flag.

Inputed the command
```bash
hello hackers
```
Note: don't input
```bash
hello hackers!
```
## What I learned
> the first word inputted acts as a command and following as a  argument
