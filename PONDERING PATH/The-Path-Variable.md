**Problem** : The problem is to run /challenge/run such that it won't destroy the flag
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cPFePBCeUCJ3F_2hJqPA51AjkLo.QX2cDM1wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :  followed the instructions to get the flag


```bash
PATH=''

/challenge/run
 ```


## What I learned
> * *PATH=''* will make it so that the program won't look anyhere for the commands
