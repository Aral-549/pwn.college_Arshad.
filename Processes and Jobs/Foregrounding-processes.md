# Foregrounding-processes

**Problem** : The problem is to  you need to suspend /challenge/run, resume the suspended process in the
background, and then foreground it without re-suspending it

## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wMhM2BYWksdC5YQipzXJE09nHdU.QX2QDO0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag.

Inputed the command
bash
```bash
/challenge/run # Ctrl +Z
bg
fg

```


## What I learned
> * learned how to resume use *bg* and *fg* commands collectively
