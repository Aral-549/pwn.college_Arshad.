**Problem** : The problem is to redirect the output'*PWN*'  to the file '*COLLEGE*'
## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{MFf001kfI6mnyPCIMAdWIxTvzNJ.QX0YTN0wSN5gjNzEzW}`

**Thought process** :   Followed the instructions after testing once to get the flag.

Inputed the command
bash
```bash
 echo PWN > COLLEGE

```
